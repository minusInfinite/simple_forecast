**A Rainmeter Weather Skin showing Current plus a two day forecast**

After a lot of testing and phasing I've put together a small Weather forecast Skin to use with Rainmeter. 
The Skin is [Powered by Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/poweredby/) 

### Installation

* Download [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/)
* Download the lastest Release - https://github.com/minusInfinite/simple_forecast/releases

The Skin needs additional details entered into the @Resources/setup.inc file order to operate.
An API Key and The Latitude and Longitude of the City you want the weather from. 

The easiest way I find to get a cities Latitude and Longitude is from a Google Map URL.


Enjoy
